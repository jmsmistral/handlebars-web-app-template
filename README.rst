---------------------

A base handlebars + node + express + postgres web app template to kick-start new projects.

How it works
------------

Use this template as a base from which expand your app.
To run the app follow these steps:

**Clone the repo**

   $ git clone https://github.com/jmsmistral/web-app-template

**Start the app**
::
   $ npm start

**How code is organized**

- New routes go in the 'routes' folder
- Logic for those routes go in the 'controllers' folder
- Handlebars layouts and templates go in the 'views' folder
- Public javascript and css files go in the 'public' folder 
- Unit and integration tests go in the 'test' folder
